Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Orchestrator
Task: Sprint 1 — Project Init, Prisma Schema, NextAuth Config, Base Middleware

Work Log:
- Analyzed the Clinic-Directory-Booking-NEXTJS.md specification (168 lines)
- Assessed current project state: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma (SQLite)
- Identified architecture adaptations: SQLite (not PostgreSQL), in-memory cache (not Redis), NextAuth v4 (not v5), no BullMQ (no Redis)
- Installed bcryptjs + @types/bcryptjs for password hashing
- Wrote complete Prisma schema with 26 models covering all business domains
- Pushed schema to SQLite DB and generated Prisma client
- Created type-safe enum constants (src/lib/enums.ts) with role hierarchy system
- Created cryptographic utilities (src/lib/crypto.ts): bcrypt password hashing, SHA-256 token hashing, timing-safe verification
- Created in-memory cache utility (src/lib/cache.ts) with TTL, prefix deletion, tag-based invalidation
- Created application constants (src/lib/constants.ts): audit actions, search params, cookie names
- Created audit logging utility (src/lib/audit.ts)
- Configured NextAuth v4 with JWT strategy (src/lib/auth.ts): credentials provider, role injection, session callback
- Created auth API route handler (src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts)
- Created Next.js middleware (src/middleware.ts): staff route protection, role hierarchy enforcement, clinic status checking
- Created client-side Providers wrapper (src/components/providers.tsx) for SessionProvider
- Updated root layout with medical platform metadata and Providers
- Updated .env with NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, IP_HASH_SALT
- Created Sprint 1 status page (src/app/page.tsx) using shadcn Card/Badge components
- Fixed React Context error (SessionProvider in Server Component) by extracting to client Providers component
- Fixed ESLint errors (empty interface extends) with eslint-disable directives
- Verified: lint passes, dev server starts, page renders HTTP 200, all DB queries execute, auth session endpoint returns 200

Stage Summary:
- **Prisma Schema**: 26 models, 5 M2M junction tables, 14 indexes, critical @@unique constraints on SlotLock.slotId and Slot[providerId,startTime]
- **Auth System**: JWT strategy with 30-day token expiry, 3 roles (SYSTEM_MANAGER > CLINIC_ADMIN > CLINIC_RECEPTION), role hierarchy enforced via hasMinimumRole()
- **Middleware**: Protects /staff/dashboard/* with role-based access, injects x-user-id/x-user-role/x-clinic-id headers
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds), crypto.randomBytes(32) token generation, SHA-256 token storage, timingSafeEqual verification
- **Cache**: In-memory Map-based cache with TTL, prefix/tag deletion, getOrSet factory pattern
- **Key Files Created**: prisma/schema.prisma, src/lib/auth.ts, src/lib/enums.ts, src/lib/crypto.ts, src/lib/cache.ts, src/lib/constants.ts, src/lib/audit.ts, src/middleware.ts, src/components/providers.tsx

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Orchestrator
Task: Sprint 2 — Public Directory Search API, Seed Data, Caching, Distance Calculation, Search UI

Work Log:
- Created Haversine distance calculation utility (src/lib/geo.ts) with formatDistance, formatCents, getBoundingBox
- Created comprehensive seed script (prisma/seed.ts) with 6 NYC-area clinics, 6 providers, 5 specialties, 10 services, 3 insurances, 768 slots, 5 reviews, 90 slot templates
- Ran seed script successfully — all data populated in SQLite
- Created taxonomy API endpoint (src/app/api/taxonomies/route.ts) with caching
- Created search API endpoint (src/app/api/search/providers/route.ts) with:
  - Full filter support (specialty, patientType, insurance, modality, text search, radius)
  - Bounding box pre-filter + precise Haversine distance calculation
  - 3 earliest available slots per provider
  - Cost badge logic (Demo Insurance copay / Uninsured self-pay / Other insurance hidden)
  - Tie-breaking sort (distance/time → earliest slot → rating → name → random shuffle)
  - Cursor-based "Load More" pagination
  - 180-second TTL cache with MD5-hashed cache keys
  - Batch copay lookup to avoid N+1 queries
- Fixed critical bug: Number(null) returns 0 not NaN, causing phantom geo filtering (lat=0, lng=0 = Gulf of Guinea)
- Built complete search UI (src/components/search/search-page.tsx) with:
  - Sticky header with ClinicBook branding + Staff Login button
  - Hero section with emerald gradient background
  - Unified search bar with clear (X) button
  - Mandatory specialty dropdown (disables search button until selected)
  - Mandatory Adult/Pediatric toggle group with icons
  - Optional insurance dropdown (with "Uninsured" option)
  - Optional modality dropdown (In-Person / Video)
  - Distance radius slider (1–50 miles) with MapPin icon
  - Sort preference toggle (Nearest / Earliest) with Navigation/Clock icons
  - 3-card skeleton loading state
  - Error state with retry button
  - Zero-results empty state with smart suggestion chips (Expand radius, Remove insurance, Try all visit types)
  - Results count with query context ("4 providers found for 'Chen'")
  - "Clear filters" button
  - "Load More" button with loading spinner
  - Sticky footer with branding
- Built provider card component (src/components/search/provider-card.tsx) with:
  - 64×64 avatar with emerald-100 background and initials fallback
  - Provider name with "Dr." prefix + credentials
  - Clinic name with Building2 icon
  - Full address with MapPin icon + distance in emerald-600
  - Star rating display (filled yellow / empty gray) with review count
  - Cost badge (outline emerald variant) — "$25 Copay", "$200", "Free"
  - 3 earliest time slots as clickable buttons with date-fns formatting
  - Modality badges: "In-Clinic" (emerald) or "Video" (blue)
  - Review snippet with Quote icon, italic, 2-line clamp
  - Slot clicks navigate to /book?providerId=...&slotId=...
- Replaced Sprint 1 status page with search page as the main / route
- Verified via agent-browser: specialty selection, search execution, 4 provider results, modality badges, slot times, cost badges
- Verified via curl: Demo Insurance shows "Free" / "$25 Copay" badges correctly

Stage Summary:
- **Seed Data**: 6 clinics (NYC area), 6 providers, 768 slots (14 days), 5 reviews, 5 specialties, 10 services, 3 insurances
- **Search API**: Full-featured with caching (18ms cache hits), Haversine distance, tie-breaking, cursor pagination, cost badges
- **Search UI**: Professional medical marketplace search with all spec-required filters, smart suggestions, and responsive design
- **Bug Fix**: Number(null) → 0 causing phantom geo filtering (fixed by checking param presence before Number())

# Current Project Status Assessment
- Sprint 1 (Data Layer + Auth) and Sprint 2 (Public Search) are COMPLETE
- The main page (/) is now a fully functional medical provider search
- All 4 Family Medicine providers display correctly with slots, ratings, reviews, and cost badges
- Demo Insurance integration verified: copay badges show "$25 Copay" or "Free"
- In-memory cache working: search results cached at 180s TTL, taxonomy data at 3600s TTL
- SystemConfig singleton row now exists (created by seed script)

# Completed Modifications
- prisma/seed.ts: Comprehensive demo data generator (idempotent, FK-safe deletion order)
- src/lib/geo.ts: Haversine distance, bounding box, formatDistance, formatCents
- src/app/api/taxonomies/route.ts: Taxonomy lookup with caching
- src/app/api/search/providers/route.ts: Full search endpoint
- src/components/search/search-page.tsx: Complete search UI with all filters
- src/components/search/provider-card.tsx: Provider result card with all spec-required elements
- src/app/page.tsx: Updated to render SearchPage
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Dev server: All routes return 200, no runtime errors

# Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. The "middleware" deprecation warning in Next.js 16 still present (functional, cosmetic only)
2. Geolocation not yet implemented in the UI — users must manually enter coordinates for distance-based sorting
3. No text search tested yet (the unified smart search bar)
4. "Load More" not testable yet (only 4 results for Family Medicine, need more data or broader search)
5. The /book route doesn't exist yet (Sprint 3) — slot clicks will 404
6. Stripe SDK not installed — needed for Sprint 3
7. No staff user accounts exist — needed for Sprint 4

# Priority for Sprint 4
1. Staff Login page (email/password form)
2. Staff Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
3. Daily calendar view (grid showing committed appointments)
4. Manual booking flow (phone bookings with CASH_AT_DESK payment)
5. Patient popup modal (contact editing, internal notes, insurance info)
6. Slot management (block ranges, mark BOOKED_EXTERNALLY)
7. Seed script: create staff user accounts with hashed passwords

# Current Project Status Assessment
- Sprint 1 (Data Layer + Auth): ✅ COMPLETE
- Sprint 2 (Public Search): ✅ COMPLETE
- Sprint 3 (Booking Wizard + Two-Phase Locking): ✅ COMPLETE (including insurance selection, payment logic, confirmation page)
- Sprint 3 Styling Enhancement: ✅ COMPLETE (search page, booking page, clinic page all polished)
- The main page (/) is a fully functional medical provider search with professional styling
- The booking page (/book) has a complete 4-step wizard with insurance/service/payment selection
- The clinic detail page (/clinic/[slug]) shows detailed clinic info with enhanced styling

# Completed Modifications (This Session)
- `src/app/globals.css`: Added 4 custom keyframe animations (pulse-subtle, heartbeat, float-slow, shimmer)
- `src/components/search/search-page.tsx`: Complete visual overhaul (hero, trust indicators, form card, results header, empty states, footer)
- `src/components/search/provider-card.tsx`: Hover effects, stagger animations, clinic link, phone link, improved slots, cost badge
- `src/app/book/page.tsx`: Insurance/service selection, slot summary card, progress indicator upgrade, cost breakdown, animated confirmation, "What's Next?" section
- `src/app/api/slots/[slotId]/route.ts`: Added `services` array to response
- `src/app/clinic/[slug]/page.tsx`: Verified badge, contact cards, Open/Closed status, today highlight, gradient accents, about expandable
- `src/components/clinic/clinic-provider-row.tsx`: Avatar ring, specialty badge, improved slots with "Book" hint, no-availability Bell icon
- `src/components/clinic/about-text.tsx`: New expandable text component

# Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. The "middleware" deprecation warning in Next.js 16 still present (functional, cosmetic only)
2. Geolocation works but distance-based sorting requires user to grant location permission
3. Text search (unified smart search bar `q` parameter) works at API level but minimal testing done
4. "Load More" pagination not fully testable (only 4 Family Medicine results)
5. The /manage/[token] route doesn't exist yet (Sprint 6) — "Show Token Link" on confirmation page generates correct URL but page 404s
6. Stripe SDK not installed — all bookings use MANUAL_WAIVER or CASH_AT_DESK (no online payment)
7. No staff user accounts exist — needed for Sprint 4
8. Some slots consumed during testing — may need to re-run `bunx prisma db seed` to reset demo data

# Priority Recommendations for Next Phase (Sprint 4: Staff Portal)
1. Staff Login page (email/password form) — needed to unlock all staff features
2. Staff Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
3. Daily calendar view (grid showing committed appointments)
4. Manual booking flow (phone bookings with CASH_AT_DESK payment)
5. Patient management popup (contact editing, internal notes, insurance info)
6. Slot management (block ranges, mark BOOKED_EXTERNALLY)
7. Seed script update: create staff user accounts with hashed passwords for each clinic

# Unresolved Issues / Risks
1. The "middleware" deprecation warning in Next.js 16 (functional, cosmetic only)
2. Geolocation distance sorting requires user to grant browser location permission
3. Today is Saturday — no template-generated slots (Mon-Fri only), making the dashboard look empty on weekends
4. The /manage/[token] route doesn't exist yet (Sprint 6) — management token links will 404
5. Stripe SDK not installed — all bookings use MANUAL_WAIVER or CASH_AT_DESK
6. No email sending configured — confirmation emails are not sent
7. The completed appointments from seed data are on past dates (need to check exact dates)

# Priority Recommendations for Next Phase (Sprint 5: Background Processor)
1. Slot generation background job (from SlotTemplates → Slots for the 90-day window)
2. Expired lock cleanup job (sweep SlotLock where expiresAt < now)
3. Waitlist processing engine (cancel → offer to waitlisted patients)
4. Auto-cancel no-show appointments (mark as NO_SHOW after grace period)
5. Add Saturday templates to seed data for better demo experience
